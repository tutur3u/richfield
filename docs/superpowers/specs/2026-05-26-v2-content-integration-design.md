# V2 Content Integration — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Scope:** `/v2` homepage only (no sub-pages)
**Foundation in place:** cover spread + magazine canvas + Lenis smooth scroll
**Goal:** Fold the full homepage content into the v2 magazine framework, resolve customer content feedback, and make every section read as a distinct editorial chapter.

---

## 1. Background

V2 (`/v2`) is the magazine-direction prototype of the Richfield homepage. It currently has:

- `CoverSpread` — full-bleed photo carousel with masthead, italic standfirst, and a Vertical TOC.
- `MagazineCanvas` — one sticky pinned canvas with 4 spreads that cross-dissolve in place (Lead, Field Note, JV, Colophon).
- Lenis-driven smooth scroll with proximity snap.
- Palette tokens: cream `oklch(0.96 0.018 82)`, ink `oklch(0.22 0.015 158)`, gold `oklch(0.74 0.115 82)`.

The design language (magazine vibe, italic Newsreader display, mono folios, ink↔cream rhythm) is already approved. What's missing is content density: v2 is currently a prototype with placeholder spreads. V1 (`/(site)`) has the real content (about, capabilities, footprint, brands, milestones, JV) but lives in a different visual language and has received content feedback that needs to land in v2.

### Scroll model (clarified)

V2 is **not** an in-place cross-dissolve canvas. Each section is a normally-scrolling chapter that can be any height; the morph transition only happens at the seam between sections (and from the cover into Section 1). Inside a section: regular vertical scroll, no pinning.

This means the existing `MagazineCanvas` (which compresses all spreads into one pinned viewport) and `MagazineMorph` (which pins a single spread to 100svh) are **not the right primitives** for the full-content homepage. A new primitive — `MagazineFlow` — replaces them for the post-cover sections.

---

## 2. What customers said (content-only feedback we incorporate)

The feedback was given against v1's design, but the design-related feedback for v1 is out of scope. Only the **content-related** items get carried into v2:

| # | Feedback | How v2 resolves it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Gold text doesn't stand out — make it pop more." | Add `--gold-strong` and `--gold-rule` tokens for higher-contrast accents; promote gold from decorative to structural (category numerals, eyebrows, hairline rules). |
| 2 | "Established 1994 — bigger; other headings too." | Closer section (§06) treats "Established 1994" as the visual climax (clamp 5rem–11rem). All section headlines use the existing `v2-size-feature`/`v2-size-standfirst` clamp scale (2.4rem–5.2rem) — already significantly larger than v1. |
| 3 | "Emphasize the stats — they're the main highlight." | Lead section (§01) gives the by-the-numbers strip a bordered "card" treatment and the heaviest weight in the section. |
| 4 | "Remove Vietnam–Malaysia–China from the stats — they're Vietnam-only." | Stat strip eyebrow becomes `BY THE NUMBERS · VIETNAM`. The cover's `VIETNAM · MALAYSIA · CHINA · SINCE 1994` masthead stripe stays (that's the group geography, not the stats). |
| 5 | "Add the map and the office headcounts: Malaysia 150, China 50, Vietnam 1,000+ (+ growing)." | Field Atlas section (§03) ports v1's `FootprintMap` SVG with these headcounts. |
| 6 | "Highlight 'three' in 'three countries and three generations.'" | Field Atlas headline renders both "three"s as italic gold. |
| 7 | "Remove the 'Vietnam, Malaysia, and China together form one operating Group' sentence — the map shows it." | Drop the sentence from Field Atlas body. |
| 8 | "Remove Export everywhere — we haven't started it yet." | Audit confirms `pillars` array in `content/en/capabilities.ts` already has 3 pillars only (no Export). §02 enforces 3-card layout; no Export card. |
| 9 | "AMOS → we distribute gummy candies for them." | `brands.ts` story already says this. Confirm AMOS appears in §04 Food category with gummy product photos (note follow-up: current `productPhotos.AMOS` lists crayons — needs gummy product photos from client. See open question #1.) |
| 10 | "Pocky → Glico (Pocky is the product, Glico is the company)." | `brands.ts` and `partnerLogos` already use "Glico". Confirm §04 logo strip and §06 colophon reference Glico, not Pocky. |
| 11 | "No big feature section per brand — just three categories with product photos beneath." | §04 The Directory: three category bands (Food / Beverages / Non-Food), each with a logo strip and a sliding product photo marquee below. No individual brand feature cells. |
| 12 | "Sections need to be visibly separated — looks flat when it's mostly one color." | Surface palette flips every section: ink (cover) → cream → ink → cream → cream+gold → ink → cream. Each section reads as a distinct page. |
| 13 | "Text legibility, eye-catching but legible." | No text-over-gradient. Photos use the existing duotone treatment; text always sits on a solid surface. |
| 14 | "No italicized 'South'." | Audit for any "South" / direction labels in v2 content and ensure they render in plain weight. |

### Feedback explicitly excluded (v1-specific, ignored)

- "Home page nav should be a shade of green" — v2 has no top nav by design; the Vertical TOC + masthead replace it.
- "Photo-band gradients hard to read" — v2 doesn't use the photo-band gradient pattern.
- "Big gap between Modern Trade heading and where-to-find-us" — Distribution sub-page concern; not on the homepage.
- "Brand page detailed structure (where to find us, retailer logos)" — Brand sub-page concern; not on the homepage.

### Component map

| Component | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `CoverSpread` | Hero carousel | **Keep as-is** (only the masthead eyebrow / TOC entries get updated to match the new section labels) |
| `MagazineCanvas` | In-place crossfading canvas | **Removed from `/v2/page.tsx`** — replaced by `MagazineFlow` |
| `MagazineMorph` | Pinned single-spread morph | **Removed from imports** (kept on disk in case useful later; unused) |
| `MagazineFlow` *(new)* | Fixed bg interpolator + seam dissolves between normally-flowing sections | **Build** |
| `LeadSpread` | §01 content | Update content (numbers, stat-strip eyebrow); restyle for normal-scroll context (no longer needs to fit in 100svh) |
| `WhatWeDoSpread` *(new)* | §02 content | Build — three capability cards on ink surface |
| `FieldAtlasSpread` *(new)* | §03 content | Build — port v1 `FootprintMap` SVG; rebuild type around v2 tokens |

| `VerticalTOC` | Right-rail wayfinding | Update entries to match the 6 sections; add active-section underline tracking |
| `FolioStrip` | Top masthead | Keep — possibly add a sticky-fadeable variant that persists past the cover (decision deferred to implementation) |

### The `MagazineFlow` primitive

A new component that wraps the post-cover sections and provides the morph-between-sections behavior.

**Behavior:**

1. Renders children inside `<div className="relative">`. Each child is expected to be a `<MagazineFlowSection>` (a thin wrapper supplying `bg` and `textOnDark` props).
2. Renders a fixed background layer (`<div className="fixed inset-0 -z-10">`) whose `background` color is a Motion value driven by scroll position.
3. On scroll, observes which section is currently in view and interpolates the fixed background between that section's `bg` and the next section's `bg` during the **last ~10svh of each section** (the "seam").
4. Each section paints a subtle blur overlay (`::before` pseudo or a `<motion.div>`) at its top edge that fades in over the seam to soften the transition.
5. Section content itself sits on a transparent or section-tinted surface above the fixed bg, so the bg color reads through.
6. Reduced motion: bg interpolation disabled, each section paints its own solid bg, no blur overlay.

**Why fixed bg instead of per-section bg + transition:** lets the bg actually morph continuously across the seam. A per-section bg with a CSS gradient at the seam would jump abruptly when scrolled past — the fixed bg approach gives true interpolation.

**Why this is the right primitive:**

- Replaces both `MagazineCanvas` (wrong because it pins, compressing all spreads into 100svh) and `MagazineMorph` (wrong because it pins a single spread to 100svh, blocking long content).
- Lets each section be any height (100svh for sparse, 200svh for the directory) and scroll naturally.
- Keeps the magazine "page-turn" feel at the seam without confining content.

### Vertical TOC behavior

- Already lists 6 entries; update labels to match (Lead / What We Do / Field Atlas / Directory / Joint Venture / Colophon).
- Add active-section tracking: as the user scrolls, the entry corresponding to the in-view section gets a gold underline that morphs along (similar to the cover pagination dots).
- Hidden below lg breakpoint (existing behavior).
- Desktop only: position becomes `fixed right-8 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2` after the cover scrolls past, so it travels with the reader. (If implementation friction is high here, accept it staying static on the cover and dropping out — decision deferred.)

---

## 5. Cross-cutting commitments

### Typography & emphasis

- Every section headline uses `v2-size-feature` or `v2-size-standfirst` (clamp 2.4rem–5.2rem) — no smaller display headlines anywhere.
- Eyebrows always `v2-mono v2-size-eyebrow` with a hairline rule prefix.
- "Three" / other emphasized words: italic + gold-strong, never just gold (the italic carries semantic weight).
- No italicized direction labels ("South", "North", etc.).

### Gold tokens

Add two siblings to the existing gold token in `app/globals.css`:

```css
--gold:        oklch(0.74 0.115 82);   /* existing — decorative */
--gold-strong: oklch(0.62 0.14 75);    /* NEW — accent text on cream */
--gold-rule:   oklch(0.58 0.15 75);    /* NEW — hairline rules on cream */
```

The Tailwind config gets matching utilities (`text-gold-strong`, `bg-gold-strong`, `border-gold-strong`, `text-gold-rule`).

Where to use which:
- `text-gold` — eyebrows on ink surfaces (current behavior, still works)
- `text-gold-strong` — eyebrows on cream surfaces, category numerals, key word emphasis
- `border-gold-rule` / `bg-gold-rule` — hairline rules above category markers and stat strips

### Surface separation

- Surface palette flips every section (cream ↔ ink, with one cream+gold-rules section in the middle for the directory).
- No two adjacent sections share the same surface.
- Reduced motion: morph seams become hard color cuts (still visibly separated).

### Photography

- Continue using existing `v2-photo-duotone` class for all hero photos.
- Text never overlaps a photo gradient. Captions sit beneath photos.
- All photos sourced from `/public/photos/`, no new image assets required for this iteration (except potentially AMOS gummy photos — see open questions).

---

## 6. Files changed

### New files

- `app/_components/v2/magazine-flow.tsx` — the `MagazineFlow` primitive + `MagazineFlowSection` wrapper
- `app/_components/v2/what-we-do-spread.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/field-atlas-spread.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/directory-spread.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/joint-venture-spread.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/colophon-spread.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/product-marquee.tsx` — horizontal motion-safe ticker used by §04

(All new spreads live at the `app/_components/v2/` root, alongside the existing `cover-spread.tsx` and `lead-spread.tsx`.)

### Modified files

- `app/v2/page.tsx` — drop `MagazineCanvas`, compose via `MagazineFlow` with the 6 sections
- `app/_components/v2/lead-spread.tsx` — update numbers (180K/300+/800+), update stat-strip eyebrow to "BY THE NUMBERS · VIETNAM", restyle stats as bordered cards, restyle layout for normal-flow context (drop the 100svh fit constraint)
- `app/_components/v2/vertical-toc.tsx` — update labels, add active-section underline tracking
- `app/_components/v2/cover-spread.tsx` — no structural change; verify eyebrow text is still correct (`VIETNAM · MALAYSIA · CHINA · SINCE 1994` stays — that's group geography, not stats)
- `app/globals.css` — add `--gold-strong` and `--gold-rule` custom properties; matching Tailwind config entries
- `content/en/site.ts` — confirm `tagline` and `taglineLong` (no change needed unless wording shifts)

### Files unused (kept on disk for reference)

- `app/_components/v2/magazine-canvas.tsx`
- `app/_components/v2/magazine-morph.tsx`

These are removed from imports but kept on disk in case a future iteration revisits the in-place crossfade pattern.

### Content files audited (no changes expected)

- `content/en/brands.ts` — already updated for AMOS gummies, Glico (not Pocky)
- `content/en/capabilities.ts` — already 3 pillars (no Export)
- `content/en/photography.ts` — partnerLogos and productPhotos cover everything needed

---

## 7. Out of scope (explicitly deferred)

- Sub-pages (`/v2/brands`, `/v2/distribution`, etc.) — covered in a later cycle.
- Site-wide top navigation for v2 — magazine wayfinding is masthead + Vertical TOC.
- v1 design feedback that doesn't translate to v2 (green nav color, photo-band gradients, modern-trade hierarchy of the distribution page, brand-page retailer logos).
- Performance optimization of the cover carousel beyond what exists.
- Internationalization (the content remains English-only; the directory structure `content/en/` suggests future localization but is not part of this spec).

---

## 8. Open questions

1. **AMOS product photos.** Current `productPhotos.AMOS` array in `photography.ts` lists crayons (`amos-amos.webp`, `amos-bunny.webp`, `amos-hero.webp`). Customer feedback says AMOS is gummy candies. Either (a) AMOS gummy product photos need to be sourced from the client and added to `/public/photos/products/`, or (b) the directory's AMOS row in §04 falls back to logo-only until photos arrive. The implementation plan should call out which we're doing.

2. **Caretex product photos.** Likewise — confirm whether Caretex product photos exist. (`brands.ts` mentions Caretex as personal care; not visible in current `productPhotos`. May need source from client.)

3. **Active-section TOC tracking — keep on cover or only show after.** Implementation question: does the Vertical TOC stay visible on the cover (current behavior) and become fixed after the cover scrolls past, or does it only appear once §01 enters view? Recommend the former (continuous wayfinding) but accept the latter if the fixed-positioning transition is fragile.

---

## 9. Success criteria

A reviewer scrolling /v2 after this work should be able to say:

1. Every customer content-feedback item from the brief is visibly addressed (use the table in §2 to verify).
2. Each of the 6 sections feels like a distinct magazine "page" — surface palette changes, headlines are large enough to read as section dividers, content within is dense but legible.
3. The morph transition between sections feels intentional (a soft color/blur dissolve at the seam, not a hard cut, not a jarring full-viewport pin).
4. The Vertical TOC reflects the section the reader is in.
5. The cover masthead, Lead headline, "Three" emphasis in §03, category dividers in §04, and the **1994** in §06 each register as the gold-touched typographic statements they're meant to be.
6. No Export anywhere. No italicized "South" anywhere. No text overlapping a photo gradient.
7. Reduced-motion users see solid surfaces with hard cuts between sections — still legible, still chaptered.

---

## 10. Revision 2026-05-27 — Snap-paged morph + magazine fill

After landing the initial implementation, three issues surfaced from review:

1. The morph between sections was invisible — `MagazineFlow` interpolated the fixed bg correctly but the seam window was too narrow (~1.6% of total scroll) and three adjacent sections shared the same cream surface.
2. Four sections (§02, §03, §05, §06) had no photography at all, reading as empty pages between the photographed ones.
3. Internal layouts were all the same 12-col grid, so the page felt uniform rather than like distinct editorial pages.

This revision addresses all three. The brief: **the page should read as six discrete editorial pages glued together by a momentary morph at each seam.** No long continuous scroll where the bg happens to dissolve mid-flow — six pages, six morphs.

### 10.1 Snap-paged scroll model

`MagazineFlow` adopts a snap behavior at every section top, in both directions:

- Any wheel/touch input that crosses a section boundary parks the reader at the next (or previous) section's top. Even an aggressive flick locks at the next seam — it cannot skip past content.
- Lenis (already mounted in `LenisProvider`) drives the snap. `MagazineFlow` reads section top offsets on mount + resize, and on each scroll-settle event (or low-velocity sample near a boundary) calls `lenis.scrollTo(sectionTop, { duration: 1.1, easing: ease-out-expo })` to commit the snap.
- During the snap animation (≈1.1s), the fixed-bg color crossfades from the outgoing section's `bg` to the incoming section's `bg`. A thin gold-rule "sweep" overlay slides full-width across the seam line, and the outgoing edge gets a brief blur+darken (≤8px, ≤180ms) before the incoming top fades in. This is the morph.
- Cover → §01 keeps its existing morph (already approved); the snap engages from §01 onward.
- Reduced-motion: snap is disabled, sections behave as normal scroll, bg is solid per section, morph is a hard color cut.

This makes scroll feel page-like (magazine-grade) while preserving the editorial richness of long sections in between.

### 10.2 Surface palette — no adjacent duplicates

Original: cream → ink → cream → cream → cream-gold → ink → cream (three adjacent cream sections, three invisible seams).

Revised:

| § | Section | Surface | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | The Lead | `cream` `oklch(0.96 0.018 82)` | warm eggshell |
| 02 | What We Do | `ink` `oklch(0.22 0.015 158)` | dark spread |
| 03 | Field Atlas | `paper` `oklch(0.985 0.006 70)` | slightly cooler than cream — distinct from §01 |
| 04 | The Directory | `cream` with gold-rule emphasis | back to cream, but layout shift signals page change |
| 05 | The Joint Venture | `ink` | dark spread, second time |
| 06 | Colophon | `paper` | quiet close, distinct from §04 cream |

No two adjacent sections share the same surface. Every seam has a visible bg morph.

### 10.3 Photo plan — silent support

Following the user direction *"images and content support each other, less is more"*: each "empty" section gets just enough photography to ground the writing, never decorative.

| § | Section | Photos | Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Lead | candid-1 (existing) | unchanged |
| 02 | What We Do | warehouse-1, distribution/gt, distribution/mt — one per pillar | tight crop above each pillar card, FIG. 02·N caption beneath, duotone |
| 03 | Field Atlas | one quiet inset (workshop-room or group-company) | small, beneath country list; grounds "deep local roots" |
| 04 | Directory | logo strips + product marquees (existing) | unchanged |
| 05 | JV | celebration or grand-opening | dominant column photo; Dory Rich logo+link becomes inset on the opposite column |
| 06 | Colophon | group-company-1920 | full-bleed band above the "Established 1994" lockup |

Map (§03) gets a proper SE-Asia outline SVG instead of the abstract dot pattern, so it reads as a real map at a glance. Pulse dots and gold dashed connector arcs stay.

### 10.4 Internal structure variations

Stop reusing the same 12-col grid every section. Quiet variations only — clean, not flashy:

- **§01 Lead** — unchanged (drop cap + 7/5 split + stat card)
- **§02 What We Do** — three photo-led cards (photo top, numeral, name, body, signature stat). Cards stack on mobile, 3-col on lg.
- **§03 Field Atlas** — left rail (5-col) text + country list; right (7-col) real SE-Asia map. Inset photo below the country list, not overlapping the map.
- **§04 Directory** — band stack (existing). One quiet full-bleed photo break between Beverages and Non-Food (using a candid or workshop photo) to break the rhythm without slowing the read.
- **§05 JV** — photo dominant (7-col on lg) with the Dory Rich logo+link card as 5-col inset. Photo carries the editorial weight; logo card is supporting.
- **§06 Colophon** — full-bleed group photo at the top, then centered display lockup ("Established / 1994.") beneath, then the existing 4-col contact dl.

### 10.5 What stays the same

- Typography scale, eyebrow system, drop cap in §01, gold tokens, mono folios.
- Vertical TOC behavior.
- Cover spread.
- All content/strings (numbers, headlines, body copy) — content already matched the customer feedback in the initial implementation; this revision only adjusts visual treatment.
- Reduced-motion fallback semantics (hard cuts, no animation).

### 10.6 Files changed by this revision

### 10.7 Country correction — Myanmar / Vietnam / Cambodia

After the revision plan was set, the customer sent their official footprint
map. The actual three operating territories are **Vietnam · Cambodia ·
Myanmar**, NOT the Vietnam / Malaysia / China combination from the earlier
written brief. The brief was outdated.

Per the customer map, headcounts are:

- Vietnam — 1,820 (HQ, the largest)
- Cambodia — 151
- Myanmar — 75

Files updated to reflect this:

- `app/_components/v2/field-atlas-spread.tsx` — country list, halos, connector arcs, pin anchors, aria-label all reflect MM / VN / KH.
- `app/_components/v2/cover-spread.tsx` — masthead eyebrow now reads `VIETNAM · CAMBODIA · MYANMAR · SINCE 1994`.
- `app/_components/v2/colophon-spread.tsx` — colophon sub-line now reads `VIETNAM · CAMBODIA · MYANMAR · THIRTY YEARS`.
- `__tests__/sections/v2/field-atlas-spread.test.tsx`, `colophon-spread.test.tsx`, `e2e/v2.spec.ts` — assertions updated to match.

Not changed:

- §01 Lead body keeps the heritage line *"Rooted in a Malaysian family business now in its third generation"* — this is about the family-business origin, distinct from where operations are today. Magazines routinely keep founding-story language separate from current-footprint language. If the customer wants the heritage line dropped or softened, that's a follow-up.
- `content/en/site.ts` and `content/en/careers.ts` still contain `Vietnam · Malaysia · China` strings, but those feed the V1 site at `/(site)/*`, not `/v2`. Out of scope for this revision.
